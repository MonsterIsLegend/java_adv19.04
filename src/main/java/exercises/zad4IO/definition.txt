Overview.
map() and flatMap() APIs stem from functional languages. In Java 8, we can find them in Optional, Stream and in CompletableFuture (although under a slightly different name).
Streams represent a sequence of objects whereas optionals are classes that represent a value that can be present or absent. Among other aggregate operations, we have the map() and flatMap() methods.
Despite the fact that both have the same return types, they are quite different. Let's explain these differences by analyzing some examples of streams and optionals.
